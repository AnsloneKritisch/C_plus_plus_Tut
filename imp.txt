c++ > intermediate level language , oops , mixture of high and low level language
Bjarne Stroustrup Bell Laboratories in 1979

c -> proceduarl , top down , data can move freely , expansion of program difficult 


3 types of data type ->
built in -> int float
derived -> array function 
user defined -> structure , union



class -> user defined datatype which  store lot of function which we create and , which we can use later by using objects

object -> states the behavior of the class , we can use all the function inside the class using object

Accessibitly -> private protected public

contruction -> is a special type of function which automatically called while object creation 

it main funtion is to initialize the object 
type -> default , parameter , copy

destructor -> deallocate the memory which is allocated by constructor 

friend -> can acess private and protected member of class
 friend void anshu (clas , ref)
friend class bhi same hota hai

friend class Anshu ;

Abstraction by which only nessary data is shown to the user rest are hidden 

Ecapsulation -> help to wrap data members into single function
main work is to secure data 

Inheretance when one class acess property of another class 
single , multi , heirarchal inheretance 
class A : public class b 
class A : public b , public a 

polymorphism -> same object having same behavior

compile time poly -a, overloading 
more than one fuction with saem or different parametertfa-spin

run time poly morphis overriding 

when class and its function are repeated then the class which is formed later replace the class formed before it
